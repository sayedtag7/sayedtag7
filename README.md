## 👋 About Me  

My name is **Sayed Tag-Eldin**, and I’m a passionate **AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist** based in **Egypt**.  
I’ve been deeply involved in AI and data-driven technologies through **academic projects, freelancing roles, and international competitions**.  

Over the past year, I’ve worked on several impactful projects. One of the most notable was an **AI-powered Quality Management System** for over 50 manufacturers, where I led the development of intelligent analytics and predictive models to improve production quality.  

I also had the honor of securing **2nd place globally in the Huawei ICT Competition in China**, where my team developed an innovative AI solution under real-world pressure. Additionally, I ranked **1st in the Benha Hackathon 2025** with **Smile App**, an AI tool that supports autistic students with emotional recognition and response.  

I’m also active in the tech community:  
- **Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador**  
- **Huawei Cloud Ambassador**
